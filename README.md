# Grokking Concurrency in Go

This repository contains my idiomatic Go implementations of the code examples from
"[Grokking Concurrency](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-concurrency)" by Kirill Bobrov.

This is **not** the official repository. The code is for educational purposes only.
For the original Python examples, see [luminousmen/grokking_concurrency](https://github.com/luminousmen/grokking_concurrency).
