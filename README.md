# Grokking Concurrency in Go

This repository contains my idiomatic Go implementations of the code examples from
"[Grokking Concurrency](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-concurrency)" by Kirill Bobrov.

This is **not** the official repository. The code is for educational purposes only.
For the original Python examples, see [luminousmen/grokking_concurrency](https://github.com/luminousmen/grokking_concurrency).

All the code examples have been tested with Go 1.25 on MacOS 26.1.
No additional dependencies are required.

To install Go, please follow the instructions at [golang.org/doc/install](https://golang.org/doc/install).
To run a program from the terminal:

```sh
go run <filename>.go
```
